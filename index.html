        Hi, I'm Architaa Swain, a passionate and driven individual with a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from KIIT Deeemed to be University, Bhubaneswar alongside an Executive Post Graduate Certification in Data Science and AI from iHUB DivyaSampark | Intellipaat, Bengaluru.

I specialize in Python, SQL and data analysis tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. My expertise lies in software development and AI-driven solutions, which I have showcased through innovative projects such as:
<ul class="inline-projects">
    <li><strong>Ovarian Cyst Detection using MobileNetV2:</strong> An AI-based solution for healthcare diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Covid Vaccine Platform:</strong> A machine learning project to forecast vaccine demand and analyze adverse reactions using Scikit-learn and KNN algorithms.</li>
  </ul>
I have earned certifications from AWS, Hackerrank, IBM and Coursera, participated in hackathons and contributed to technical challenges. My research publications and volunteering experience reflect my dedication to continuous learning and collaboration.

With a strong problem-solving mindset, I aim to contribute to data-driven solutions that make a meaningful impact across various industries, particularly in healthcare and technology.

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Vaccine Platform</h3>
      <p>This AI-driven platform utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast vaccine demand and detect areas with low vaccination coverage. It integrates real-time data analysis and API synchronization for seamless healthcare system integration. The platform also analyzes adverse reactions using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to provide personalized insights and support decision-making in public health strategies.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Ovarian Cyst Detection using MobileNetV2(Team Collaboration)</h3>
        <p>This advanced AI-based project utilizes deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect ovarian cysts from medical imaging data. Developed as part of a team collaboration, the project combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with real-world healthcare challenges. It aims to provide early and accurate detection of ovarian cysts, improving diagnostic efficiency and helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions. The solution integrates image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases to ensure robust and reliable results in clinical settings.</p>
